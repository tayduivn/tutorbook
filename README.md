**[Tutorbook](https://tutorbook.org) is the best way to manage tutoring and
mentoring programs (virtually).** See the
[`ROADMAP`](https://github.com/tutorbookapp/tutorbook/blob/develop/ROADMAP.md)
for a high-level overview of what's being worked on and what's coming.

It's an online app used by organizations (i.e. nonprofits, K-12 schools) to:

- Match students with tutors and mentors (e.g. by subjects, availability,
  languages spoken).
- Manage and track those matches (e.g. via a communications timeline and tags).

Students use Tutorbook to:

- Search their school's tutors/mentors themselves (instead of having an admin
  match them up).
- Keep track of appointments and availability (e.g. via the schedule view).

Parents and teachers use Tutorbook to:

- Request tutors/mentors for their students (those requests are then fulfilled
  by an admin who matches the student with the appropriate tutor/mentor).
- Track their student's matches (e.g. via the communications timeline).

## Terminology and Data Model

This is a high-level overview of the various resources ("things") manipulated by
and created through the app.

**Note:** This section is not a complete technical definition of our data model.
Instead, please refer to
[`lib/model`](https://github.com/tutorbookapp/tutorbook/tree/master/lib/model)
for always up-to-date Typescript data model definitions.

### `User`

A user is a person. This person could be a tutor, mentor, student, admin or all
of them at the same time. Those roles are not inscribed on each user but rather
implied by role-specific properties (e.g. a mentor will have subjects specified
in their `mentoring.subjects` property).

### `Org`

An org is a school or nonprofit or other business entity that is using TB to
manage their tutoring and mentoring programs.

### `Request`

A request is a job post. Typically created by parents or teachers, it comprises
of:

- The student who needs help (e.g. "Nicholas Chiang").
  - When the student is available (this is included in the student's profile).
- The subjects he/she needs help with (e.g. "AP Computer Science A"). This is
  also added to the student's profile under their `tutoring.searches` property.
- A concise description of what specifically the student is struggling with
  (e.g. "Nicholas doesn't understand Java arrays and sorting algorithms").

**Note:** Requests can also be created by admins (and often are). For example,
an admin might need to migrate the results of a Google Form to Tutorbook (by
creating the requests all at once and then fulfilling them over time).

Once created, a request is fulfilled by an admin, who searches on behalf of the
student and creates a match (between the student and an appropriate
tutor/mentor).

### `Match`

A match is a pairing of people (typically between a single student and a single
tutor/mentor, but there can be group pairings as well). Matches can specify
times (e.g. "Every Monday at 3-4pm") and meeting venues (e.g. "Use this Zoom
meeting room" or "Use this Google Meet link").

- Students create matches when they "send a request" to a tutor/mentor from the
  search view.
- Admins can directly create matches (e.g. when migrating from an existing
  system, admins know who's matched with whom).
- Admins can create matches to fulfill requests (e.g. a teacher requests help
  for their struggling student and the admin finds that help).

Upon creation, Tutorbook sends an email to everyone in the match (all of the
`attendees`) with everyone's anonymous contact info.

Tutorbook has a system like
[Craigslist's](https://www.craigslist.org/about/anonymize) where each attendee
in each match has a unique anonymous email address (e.g.
`88626b40-49c7-bd16-a845-ece7527cded7@mail.tutorbook.org`). Emails can then be
intercepted by Tutorbook and added to the in-app communications timeline before
being relayed to their intended recipients.

## Design Specifications

Summarized here are descriptions of common data flow patterns and design specs.
These are some of the front-end design guidelines that TB follows in order to
maintain consistency and display predictable behavior.

### Analytics

TB uses [Segment](https://segment.com) to collect analytics from both the client
and the server. When defining events, we use Segment's recommended
[object-action framework](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/).
Each event name includes an object (e.g. Product, Application) and an action on
that object (e.g. Viewed, Installed, Created).

### Zoom Integration

TB ([Tutorbook](https://tutorbook.app)) creates new recurring Zoom meetings for
every [match](#match). To do so, TB stores Zoom OAuth refresh tokens and account
IDs within [user](#user) and [org](#org) profiles.

Orgs have two options when authorizing TB to use their Zoom account:

1. **Create new users:** TB will create new Zoom users (within the org's Zoom
   account) for each user created on TB (using the user's _actual_ email address
   and falling back to the user's _TB-assigned anonymous_ email address
   (e.g. `dfadf-adwei8e-dw934sd@mail.tutorbook.org` instead of
   `my.personal.email@gmail.com`) if that fails). TB then uses those Zoom users
   when creating Zoom meetings.
   - Requires both the **meeting:write:admin** scope _and_ the
     **user:write:admin** scope.
2. **Assume users already exist:** TB will assume that Zoom users (using the
   user's _actual_ email address) already exist (within the org's Zoom account)
   for each user created on TB. TB then reuses those existing Zoom users when
   creating Zoom meetings.
   - Requires only the **meeting:write:admin** scope.

Smaller orgs may opt for option one (for convenience) while larger orgs (e.g.
entire school districts) will likely use option two (because they already have
Zoom users for each of their students and tutors).

Option two is recommended when possible because it does not require users to
login to Zoom using their TB-assigned anonymous email address (as they must be
logged into the correct Zoom account to host the [match](#match) Zoom meetings).

Because [Zoom pricing](https://zoom.us/pricing) is per user license, TB will
only create Zoom user accounts when it has to (i.e. when a [match](#match) is
created and none of the match's `people` already have Zoom user accounts). When
creating a Zoom meeting for a match:

1. TB will first try using the tutor or mentor Zoom user accounts.
2. If that fails, TB will try using the student (i.e. `tutee` and `mentee`) Zoom
   user accounts.
   - TB will not attempt to use `people` who do not have any `roles` listed (as
     those people were likely added just because they were on an email thread
     with one of the tutors, mentors, or students).
3. If all of that fails (i.e. there are no existing Zoom user accounts for the
   match's people within the match's org), TB will try to create a new Zoom user
   account for the match's tutor or mentor within the match's org.
4. If that still fails (i.e. the org chose option two and doesn't allow TB to
   create new Zoom users), TB will fallback to using [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org).

For more info on our Zoom integration, see [this
issue](https://github.com/tutorbookapp/tutorbook/issues/100).

### Forms and Data Mutation

There are two types of data entry forms used throughout TB:

1. **Single update forms.** These are forms that are explicitly submitted by the
   user upon completion (think Google Forms; must be submitted to be saved).
   - Includes inputs, submission button, loading overlay, and error message.
   - Upon submission, these forms:
     1. Show a loading state that prevents further user input.
     2. Immediately mutate local data (to start any expensive re-rendering).
     3. Update remote data with a POST or PUT API request.
     4. If the server sends an error, reset local data and show error message.
        Otherwise, mutate local data with the server's response.
     5. Hide the loading state. Data has been updated or an error has occurred.
   - Ex: New request form, edit user form (in people dashboard), sign-up form.
2. **Continuous update forms.** These are forms that continually receive user
   input, mutate local data, and update remote data at set intervals (think
   Google Docs; continually auto-saves user input).
   - Includes inputs (shows error message via a snackbar).
   - Upon update, these forms:
     1. Immediately mutate local data (unless such a mutation would cause too
        much expensive re-rendering delaying further user input).
     2. Set a timeout to update the remote data (e.g. after 5secs of no change,
        update the remote). Clear any existing timeouts.
     3. Update remote data with a POST or PUT API request.
     4. If the server sends an error, show an error message via a snackbar and
        retry the request. Local data stays mutated. Otherwise, mutate local
        data with the server's response.
   - Ex: Org settings form, profile form, query/search form.

Also feel free to check out our recently added `tutorials/` directory for
additional information detailing different aspects of this project (e.g. tests,
deployment workflows, CI/CD, etc).

This project uses (please ensure that you're familiar with our tech stack before
trying to contribute; it'll save your reputation and a lot of time):

#### Languages

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - As our language of choice
  (mostly for static typing, stronger linting capabilities, and the potential
  for beautifully detailed--and completely automatically generated--
  documentation). Typescript is also [well supported by
  Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) and
  [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/static-type-checking.html#typescript).
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - For styling components (i.e. CSS on steroids).
  Sass, like Typescript, is also [well supported by Next.js
  out-of-box.](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support)

#### Frameworks

- [React](https://reactjs.org) - As our front-end framework.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - To easily support
  [SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) and
  other performance [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) features.
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) - Used to manage global state. SWR fetches data
  from our back-end, stores it in a global cache, and allows local mutations of
  that cache (with or without automatic revalidation).

#### Tooling

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - To manage dependencies much faster than NPM (and
  for better community support, advanced features, etc).
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) - For code linting to avoid
  common mistakes and to enforce styling. Follow [these
  instructions](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) to install it
  in the text editor of your choice (such that you won't have to wait until our
  pre-commit hooks fail to update your code).
- [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io) for integration, UI, and some unit tests.
  Cypress is like Selenium; but built from the ground-up with the developer in
  mind. Cypress runs alongside your code in the browser, enabling DOM snapshots,
  time travel, and overall faster test runs.

#### Database

- [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For their [NoSQL
  document-based database](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore),
  [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth), and other
  useful (relatively drop-in) solutions.
- [Algolia](https://algolia.com/doc) is synced with our [Firestore
  database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) via [GCP
  Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/firestore-events). TB
  uses Algolia for subject and language selection and to power the primary
  search view capabilities.

## Development Environment

To setup a development environment for and to contribute to the TB website:

1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
   to install `nvm` (our suggested way to use Node.js) on your
   machine. Verify that `nvm` is installed by running:

```
$ command -v nvm
```

2. (Optional) If you use [Vim](https://vim.org) as your preferred text editor,
   follow [these instructions](https://freshman.tech/vim-javascript) on setting
   up [Vim](https://vim.org) for editing JavaScript.
3. Run the following command to install Node.js v12.18.3 (our current version):

```
$ nvm i 12.18.3
```

4. (Optional) Run the following command to set Node.js v12.18.3 as your default
   Node.js version (useful if you have multiple Node.js versions installed and
   don't want to have to remember to switch to v12.18.3):

```
$ nvm alias default 12.18.3
```

5. Ensure that you have recent versions of Node.js and it's package manager
   `npm` by running:

```
$ node -v
12.18.3
$ npm -v
6.14.7
```

6. (Optional) Install the [Cypress system dependencies](https://bit.ly/2QHuAiG)
   if you plan on running our integration tests locally.

```
$ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2 libxtst6 xauth xvfb
```

7. Clone and `cd` into this repository locally by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tutorbookapp/tutorbook.git && cd tutorbook/
```

8. Follow [these instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to
   install `yarn` (our dependency manager for a number of reasons):

```
$ npm i -g yarn
```

9. Then, install of our project's dependencies with the following command:

```
$ yarn
```

10. Follow the instructions included below (see "Available Scripts") to start a
    [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) development server (to see your updates affect
    the app live):

```
$ yarn dev
```

11. Message me (DM **@nicholaschiang** on
    [Slack](https://tutorbookapp.slack.com)) once (not if) you get the following
    error (I have to give you some Firebase API keys to put in the `.env` file):

```
Error [FirebaseError]: projectId must be a string in FirebaseApp.options
```

12. Finally, `cd` into your desired component or lib utility, make your changes,
    commit them to a branch off of `develop`, push it to a [fork of our
    repository](https://github.com/tutorbookapp/covid-tutoring/fork), and open a
    PR on GitHub. For more details, see [our git branching
    workflow](#git-branching-workflow).

## Available Scripts

All of the below scripts come directly from
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started). In the project directory,
you can run:

#### `yarn dev`

This command runs two scripts [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently):

1. Runs `next dev` with the Node.js `--inspect` flag on (useful for `debugger`
   statements) to start the Next.js development server.
2. Runs `firebase emulators:start` to start the [Firebase Emulator
   Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite).

Open [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) to view the app in the browser
(note that TB uses `0.0.0.0` instead of the default `localhost` for [Intercom
support](https://bit.ly/3cAWfLv). The page will hot-reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the
(locally-running) Firebase development console. Here, you can manually seed
Firestore data and view GCP Function logs.

#### `yarn build`

Runs `next build` which builds the application for production usage.

#### `yarn start`

Runs `next start` which starts a Next.js production server. I have no use for
this right now because I'm deploying to Vercel NOW which handles that for me.

#### `yarn analyze`

Runs the build to generate a bundle size visualizer.

#### `yarn lint`

Runs all of ESLint tests. This should rarely be necessary because you should
have ESLint integrated into your IDE (and thus it should run as you edit code)
and I have Husky running `pretty-quick` before each commit (which should take
care of the styling that ESLint enforces).

#### `yarn style`

Runs our code styling Husky pre-commit hook. TB uses
[Prettier](https://prettier.io) to enforce consistent code formatting throughout
the codebase.

A pre-commit hook is used to format changed files found on commit, however it is
still recommended to install the Prettier plugin in your code editor to ensure
consistent code style.

## Git Branching Workflow

I stole (and slightly modified) this GitFlow model from [Toggl's mobile
team](https://github.com/toggl/mobile-docs/blob/develop/superflow.md) which
stole it from [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model).

> To ensure - as much as possible - the quality and correctness of our code, and
> to enable many contributors to work on our apps at the same time without
> getting in each other's way we use a modified version of the GitFlow work flow
> [by Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model).
>
> We call this work flow **SuperFlow**.

Below you will find Vincent's original diagram adapted and extended
corresponding to SuperFlow followed by an explanation of the various concepts
and steps involved.

### SuperFlow

![SuperFlow diagram](https://github.com/toggl/mobile-docs/blob/develop/images/superflow.png)

**Legend:**

- Purple bubble: start of a release or hot fix branch
- Yellow bubble: release tag
- Green arrow: merge that requires review

### Branches

**Unless explicitly stated otherwise (either here or by the branch's owner),
only a branch's creator may push changes to it.** Other developers may always
create pull requests to submit changes to the branch.

#### `develop`

`develop` is our main branch. It corresponds with the current work-in-progress
state of the app, that we deal with most often as developers.

`develop` is a protected branch and no commits can be pushed to it directly. The
only way to add features, fix bugs, and make other changes is through pull
requests that pass review and automated tests.

**`develop` should always be stable and ready for release**. Any features that
are merged only partially must be disabled in code or using a pre-compiler
directive so that they do not affect release builds.

#### Feature branches

Feature branches are branches created by developers based on `develop` which are
used to create new features, fix bugs, and make other changes to the app.

These branches are updated with Vercel deploy previews and Cypress integration
tests on GitHub.

When a feature or change is done, it is merged into `develop` via a reviewed and
tested pull request. **This merge should always happen using a squash**, unless
there is a special case that requires an exception.

Typically, once a feature or change is merged into `develop` I'll then proceed
to [release it locally](#release-branches).

#### Release branches

Release branches are one of the only two ways of creating a new public release.
They are branched off of `develop` and stay alive until the corresponding
version is released.

The only commits that may be pushed directly to release branches are version
increments. All other changes must be applied using pull requests from release
bug fix branches.

Once work on a release branch is completed and sufficiently tested, the branch
is merged back into `develop` to incorporate all changes there. The `develop`
branch is then merged into `master` to trigger a new production build. **These
merges always happens using a rebase and merge** to ensure the release tags do
not point to orphaned commits.

Typically, I'll just do this all locally (bypassing the release branch):

1. Merge `develop` into `master` (adds features and bug fixes).
2. Run `release minor` to:
   - Increment the version number.
   - Trigger a new GitHub release.
   - Push changes to GitHub to trigger a production build on Vercel.
3. Merge `master` into `develop` (updates the version tag).

#### Release bug fixes

Release bug fix branches are branched off of a release branch if bugs are found
during testing of a pre-release build. The bug is fixed on that branch, after
which it is squashed back into the release branch using a reviewed pull request.
**The owner of the release branch must always agree to this** to ensure only
minimally necessary changes are included in the release.

#### Hot fixes

Hot fix branches are branched off of the latest release tag (typically the
`HEAD` on both `develop` and `master`) in the case of a critical bug in a
released build. They are the second of two ways of creating a new public
release.

In most cases the bug can be fixed directly on the hot fix branch and does not
require pull requests.

Once work on a hot fix branch is completed and sufficiently tested, the branch
is merged back into `develop` to incorporate all changes there. The `develop`
branch is then merged into `master` to trigger a new production build. **This
merge always happens using a rebase and merge** to ensure the release tags do
not point to orphaned commits.

### Release workflow

The above explanations of SuperFlow are not only a sub-set of allowed
operations, but are in fact exhaustive. This means that there are no other valid
ways to create releases, than outlined above.

In summary:

- Release and hot fix branches are the only two ways of creating new public
  releases.
- Release branches branch from `develop` and hot fix branches branch from the
  latest release tag (typically also the `HEAD` of `develop`).
- Release and hot fix branches are always merged into `develop` on completion.
  This merge is always performed using a rebase and merge (to maintain a linear
  commit history).

#### Versioning

Our apps follows the following versioning scheme:

    major.minor[.maintenance]

- The `major` component is changed only upon special considerations.
- The `minor` component is incremented by one as the first commit of every
  release branch **(and in no other case)**. The same commit also removes the
  `maintenance` component.
- The `maintenance` is added and incremented by one as the first commit of every
  hot fix branch **(and in no other case)**.

In essence, the versioning scheme can thus be thought of as:

    major.release[.hot_fix]
